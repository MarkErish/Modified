                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                        document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                        MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                        JavaScript.[2]

                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
                        and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                        control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                        repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
                        load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                        speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
                        for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
                        applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
                        predictable.

                        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media
                        type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C
                        operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

                        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML,
                        SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
                        be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
                        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                        JavaScript.

                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
                        originally included cues for its appearance.

                        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means
                        to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
                        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
                        using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input tags directly introduce content into the page.
                        Other tags such as
                    p tags and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
                    Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of
                    HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element,
                        together with JavaScript.</p>
